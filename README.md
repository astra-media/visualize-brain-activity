The Goal of this project was to create real-time visual illustration by reading brain activity. 

Devices & Software list: 
* Emotiv BCI headset (https://www.emotiv.com/insight/)
* TouchDesigner (https://derivative.ca/)

In this example Emotive headset reads brain activity and sends those data to touchdesigner software. 
Then the software generates visual illustration based on the data that it received.
